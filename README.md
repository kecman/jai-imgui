# jai-imgui

An alternate IMGUI wrapper for Jai

## Building demos

`jai build.jai`

Then run

`example_null.exe` to see a command-line (non-graphical) test of the bindings, or

`imgui_opengl_test.exe`

to see the ImGui demo window. You can do `Examples->Dockspace` to test out docking.

One gotcha here: there's an ImGui module included in Jai. The demos expect THIS imgui library to be `#import`ed. So your build script in your own project must modify the modules path. See `build.jai`.

## 

Make sure we have the `cimgui/` folder, and IT has its own `imgui/` folder.

This project utilizes the metadata generated by the `cimgui` but generates `.jai` module files that directly link to the C++ ImGui DLL, so no `cimgui.dll` required in your actual project.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build `imgui.lib` and `imgui.dll`.

```
build_windows_libs.bat
```

Generate cimgui's description JSON files.

```
generate_cimgui_json.bat
```

And finally generate the jai bindings.

```
generate_bindings.bat
```
